🍃 Potato Leaf Disease Detection 🌱

A deep learning-based system for detecting potato leaf diseases using image classification. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and categorize common potato leaf diseases, helping farmers and agricultural professionals take timely action.


🔹 Features:

✅ Image-based disease detection

✅ Pretrained deep learning models (e.g., CNN, ResNet, or MobileNet)

✅ Real-time prediction

✅ User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images

✅ Visualization of model predictions

🛠 Tech Stack:

Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Flask (for web-based deployment)

🚀 How to Use:

Upload an image of a potato leaf.

The model analyzes and predicts the disease.

Get a detailed result with the disease name and confidence score.

📌 Coming Soon: Mobile-friendly UI, expanded dataset, and improved model accuracy.
